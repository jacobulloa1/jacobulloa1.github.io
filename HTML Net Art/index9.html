The Unreturning</h1>

<h4 style="text-align:center;color:white;">
Suddenly night crushed out the day and hurled<br>
Her remnants over cloud-peaks, thunder-walled.<br>
Then fell a stillness such as harks appalled<br>
When far-gone dead return upon the world.<br>
<br>
There watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.<br>
Each one whom Life exiled I named and called.<br>
But they were all too far, or dumbed, or thralled,<br>
And never one fared back to me or spoke.<br>
<br>
Then peered the indefinite unshapen dawn<br>
With vacant gloaming, sad as half-lit minds,<br>
The weak-limned hour when sick men's sighs are drained.<br>
And while I wondered on their being withdrawn,<br>
Gagged by the smothering Wing which none unbinds,<br>
I dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.
