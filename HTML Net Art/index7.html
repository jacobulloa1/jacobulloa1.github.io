Vampires</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;color:white;">
Vampires are such fragile creatures; <br>
we dread the dark, but the light destroys them ...<br>
sunlight, or a stake, or a crossâ€”such common things.<br>
Still, late at night, when the bat-like vampire sings,<br>
we shrink from his voice.<br>
<br>
Centuries have taught us:<br>
in shadows danger lurks for those who stray,<br>
and there the vampire bares his yellow fangs<br>
and feels the ancient soul-tormenting pangs.<br>
He has no choice.<br>
<br>
We are his prey, plump and fragrant,<br>
and if we pray to avoid him, the more he prays to find us ...<br>
prays to some despotic hooded God<br>
whose benediction is the humid blood<br>
he lusts to taste.
