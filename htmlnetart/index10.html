Alone</h1>

<h4 style="text-align:center;color:black;">
From childhood's hour I have not been<br>
As others were; I have not seen<br>
As others saw; I could not bring<br>
My passions from a common spring.<br>
From the same source I have not taken<br>
My sorrow; I could not awaken<br>
My heart to joy at the same tone;<br>
And all I loved, I loved alone.<br>
Then—in my childhood, in the dawn<br>
Of a most stormy life—was drawn<br>
From every depth of good and ill<br>
The mystery which binds me still:<br>
From the torrent, or the fountain,<br>
From the red cliff of the mountain,<br>
From the sun that round me rolled<br>
In its autumn tint of gold,<br>
From the lightning in the sky<br>
As it passed me flying by,<br>
From the thunder and the storm,<br>
And the cloud that took the form<br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
Of a demon in my view.
