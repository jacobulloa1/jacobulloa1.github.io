<h1 style="text-align:center;color:white;">Black Cat</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;color:white;">
A ghost, though invisible, still is like a place<br>
your sight can knock on, echoing; but here<br>
within this thick black pelt, your strongest gaze<br>
will be absorbed and utterly disappear:<br>
<br>
just as a raving madman, when nothing else<br>
can ease him, charges into his dark night<br>
howling, pounds on the padded wall, and feels<br>
the rage being taken in and pacified.<br>
<br>
She seems to hide all looks that have ever fallen<br>
into her, so that, like an audience,<br>
she can look them over, menacing and sullen,<br>
and curl to sleep with them. But all at once<br>
<br>
as if awakened, she turns her face to yours;<br>
and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny,<br>
inside the golden amber of her eyeballs<br>
suspended, like a prehistoric fly.<br>
</p>
